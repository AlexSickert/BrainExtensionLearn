General
<br><br>
1.1 BrainExtension is a service that pursues the aim of improving the efficiency and effectiveness of learning languages and other subjects by providing a variety of different applications.
<br><br>

2. Conditions of use, conclusion of contract and warranties upon conclusion of contract
<br><br>
General
<br><br>

2.2 The option to use applications offered on the BrainExtension Websites does not constitute an offer, but merely an invitation to issue an offer. By completing the booking process, the user consents to enter into the agreement to use the corresponding BrainExtension application. BrainExtension in turn accepts the user’s consent by rendering the corresponding services. The agreement takes effect upon the aforementioned acceptance by BrainExtension. BrainExtension is not obliged to enter into the agreement. By using paid services, the user accepts the related payment obligation by clicking on the confirmation button which is displayed in such cases.
<br><br>
2.3 The user warrants and represents that all of the data they provide is accurate and complete. The user is obliged to ensure that the data for all of the applications they use is accurate and complete for the entire duration of the agreement. In the event that the BrainExtension customer service team makes any manual changes to the user’s data on the user’s behalf, BrainExtension reserves the right to bill the user for any costs they incur in connection with said changes, insofar as the user is responsible for the event that triggers these costs.
<br><br>
2.4 The user warrants that they are of legal age. In the event that the user acts on behalf of a legal person for certain applications, the user warrants that they are authorised to act in the name of the legal person. Upon request, the user shall submit proof thereof.
<br><br>
2.5 It is technically impossible for BrainExtension to determine with certainty whether any user registered on the BrainExtension Websites is in fact the person he or she claims to be. Therefore, BrainExtension assumes no liability for the actual identity of a user.
<br><br>
BrainExtension App
<br><br>
2.6 In order to acquire BrainExtension membership, the user must register on the platform and select a password.
<br><br>
2.7 The user is obliged to keep this password secret. BrainExtension shall not disclose the password to any third party, shall only use it during the login process, and shall not ask for the user's password at any time other than during the login process. The user is solely responsible for safeguarding and storing its BrainExtension member account login details (particularly its password).
<br><br>
2.8 Each user may only create up to ten user profiles. The user is not permitted to allow third parties to use its user profile.

<br><br>
Unpaid membership
<br><br>
7.2 BrainExtension and the user may terminate free membership at any time without cause. In order to protect the user from unauthorised deletion of their user profile by third parties, BrainExtension may perform an identity check upon termination, e.g. by requesting the username and an e-mail address registered on the BrainExtension Websites.

Cancellation and suspension for good cause
<br><br>
7.4 Even if separate terms and conditions regarding term and cancellation are in place, both parties are entitled to immediate extraordinary termination for good cause at any time. Extraordinary termination for good cause is defined as an event which makes it unacceptable for the terminating party to continue the agreement until the end of the termination period, taking into account all circumstances of the individual case and weighing up the interests of both parties. A good cause for BrainExtension includes any of the following events:

<br><br>
(b) If the user breaches a contractual obligation
<br><br>

<br><br>
(d) If the user promotes any communities or associations, or any of their methods or activities, which are under surveillance by authorities responsible for public safety or the protection of minors

<br><br>
issue a warning.

8. Responsibility for the user’s content, data and/or other information, availability
<br><br>
8.1 BrainExtension does not accept any responsibility for any content, data and/or information provided or made available by users of the BrainExtension Websites on any external websites linked to them.

In addition, BrainExtension shall be liable without limitation for damages due to intent or gross negligence by BrainExtension or one of its legal representatives or vicarious agents.
<br><br>
9.2 Apart from the cases set out in sections 9.1 and 9.3, BrainExtension’s liability shall be limited to typical foreseeable contractual damages in the event of a breach of any of its cardinal contractual duties due to slight negligence. Cardinal contractual duties are an abstract description of those obligations whose fulfilment is indispensable for the proper implementation of an agreement and on whose fulfilment the contracting parties can usually rely. Any other liability on the part of BrainExtension is excluded.
<br><br>
9.3 Liability pursuant to the German Product Liability Act shall remain unaffected.
<br><br>

10. Data protection
